SurveyBug
=========

A simple survey generator and administrator.

Specifications:
---------------

1. Support one question type (Radio question type) and optionally checkboxes.
2. Use Javascript and ajax where possible for a more dynamic user experience.
3. A user can take a survey and there should be a page to see results.

Sample survey:
--------------

	1. What is your gender?
		(  ) Male
		(  ) Female

	2. What are your favorite color(s)?
		[  ] Red
		[  ] Blue
		[  ] Pink
		[  ] Green

	[Submit]

Assumptions:
------------

2. Results from surveys taken before a survey is changed or edited are not promised to be consistent with the latest survey.
